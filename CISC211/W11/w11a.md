# W11-a Procedures Assignment

## Task
Perform the following tasks:
1. Generate English uppercase characters from A to Z. After every character, there must be a line feed. Use procedures and loops to optimize the code. **Do not use gdb debugger**. The executable file will run directly on the terminal. See the output below.

## Solution
```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:
  mov eax, 65           ;intialize starting value 65 - 'A'

mainLoop:               ;main looping logic
  mov [printVar], eax
  call display
  call linefeed
  call handleLoop

handleLoop:             ;handles incrementing, exit, and looping logic
  mov eax, [printVar]
  inc eax
  cmp eax, 90
  jg exit
  jmp mainLoop

display:                ;display logic
  mov eax, 4
  mov ebx, 1
  mov ecx, printVar
  mov edx, 1
  int 0x80
  ret

linefeed:               ;display new line
  mov eax, 4
  mov ebx, 1
  mov ecx, space
  mov edx, 1
  int 0x80
  ret

exit:                   ;exit logic
  mov eax, 1
  int 0x80

section .bss
  printVar resd 1

section .data
  space dd 0xA
```

## Lab Questions

Q: What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?

A: The hardest part was figuring out the looping logic and decomposing the problem into multiple procedures.  There were three main parts to the program: 1) Print character 2) Print new line 3) Loop.  After I identified those procedures, the implementation was straight forward with the exception of the loop procedure.  I found out that the best way to handle looping logic is to create a seperate procedure which handles the incrementing, testing, and jumping logic that would normally be providd in a high level language loop like for or while.
