# W10 - Loops and Arrays

## Task

Perform the following tasks:

1. Generate a counter using an EBX register, debug, and explain your findings. Use the code written in the  [counter (optimized version) example](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/assembly/blob/main/loops-arrays/Lecture.html).  **2 points**
2. Calculate the final number of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers starting from 0. The result should be equal to 55. **2 points **
3. Define the array with length 3 and, type integer, find the largest element in the array. Use `gdb` to debug the code and verify that the code is working well and as per the requirement. **6 points**

## Task 1 Solution

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:          ;initialize counter
  mov ebx, 0

counter:         ;counter loop
  inc ebx
  cmp ebx, 10
  jl counter 

  mov eax, 1     ;exit
  int 0x80
```

Using the counter method for loops, reminds me of for loops in higher level languages like Java or Python.  This method gives you more control of the loop compared to the built-in loop instruction.

## Task 2 Solution

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:                   ;initialize fib loop data
  mov ecx, 9
  mov eax, 0
  mov ebx, 1

fib:                      ;main loop logic, shifting values around
  add eax, ebx
  mov edx, eax
  mov eax, ebx 
  mov ebx, edx
  
  loop fib
  mov [result], ebx
  jmp display

display:                  ;printing logic
  mov eax, [result]
  xor edx, edx
  mov ebx, 10
  div ebx
  push edx
  push eax

  pop eax                 ;pop/push method
  add eax, 48
  mov [displayVar], eax
  call print

  pop eax,
  add eax, 48
  mov [displayVar], eax
  call print

  mov eax, 4              ;linefeed
  mov ebx, 1
  mov ecx, space
  mov edx, 1
  int 0x80

  jmp exit

print:
  mov eax, 4
  mov ebx, 1
  mov ecx, displayVar
  mov edx, 1
  int 0x80
  ret

exit:                    ;exit
  mov eax, 1
  int 0x80

section .bss
  result resd 1
  displayVar resd 1

section .data
  space dd 0xa
```

## Task 3 Solution

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:                ;initialize loop data
  mov ecx, 0
  mov eax, arr
  jmp greaterLoop

greaterLoop:           ;main loop logic for comparing max and current
  mov ebx, [eax]
  cmp ebx, edx
  jg swap
  jmp continue

swap:                  ;conditonal logic for swapping max and curr
  mov edx, ebx
  jmp continue

continue:              ;end of loop logic for managing counter and arr address
  inc ecx
  cmp ecx, len
  je exit
  add eax, 4
  jmp greaterLoop

exit:                  ;exit logic
  mov [result], edx
  mov eax, 1
  int 0x80

section .bss
  result resd 1

section .data
  arr dd 4, 8, 12, 3, 42, 2, 0
  len equ 7
```

## Lab Questions

Q: What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?

A: Coming up with the looping logic for the array challenge was an interesting problem.  At first it was confusing, but after thinking about how loops are implemented in higher level languages like Java, it became clear what the necessary components of a loop should look like.  I modeled the parts of a for loop as different labels in my program: initializing section, testing section, update section, and loop body section.  I worked on these components individually, then linked them together using conditional and jumping logic.  This is commonly known as "divide and conquer" or "decomposition", and its a technique used to break a complex problem down into easily solvable parts.
